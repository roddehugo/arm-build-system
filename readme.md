# ARM Cortex-M build system

This project takes its root in my desire to better understand every step
involved in building and programming Cortex-M microcontrollers in bare-metal.

### Ambition

The goal of this project is to provide a Makefile system with scripts to build
simple to moderately complex firmware images for ARM Cortex-M processors.

It should be self-documented enough to serve as a reference for future works.

### Credit

This build system is a combination of some of the best resources available:

- [Microcontroller object oriented library by Nicolas Schodet](https://github.com/schodet/ucoolib)
- [Open source ARM Cortex-M microcontroller library by libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3)
- [RIOT the friendly OS for IoT and its ARM boards support](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT)
